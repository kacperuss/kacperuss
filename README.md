### Tech savvy with poor time management skills

Once I get through all of my old abandoned projects and push them to some repos I might link them here I guess. For now you'll have to take my word

## [Software]
- Front-end web dev (Nuxt.js)
- Internal tools and automation (Python)
- Video Games (Unity)

## [Art and Film]
- Miscellaneous 2D and 3D projects (animation, brandings, UI design[, ...])
- Video Editing and Film Directing


I'm not a professional, in any way. I treat my work as a hobby
